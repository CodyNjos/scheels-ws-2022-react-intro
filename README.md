# React Refresh Workshop

## Welcome!

Hello, and welcome to the Emerging Digital Academy: React Refresh Workshop. Today we will be going over the fundamentals of Functional Base React, so by the end you will have the skills required to make practical React applications!

## Requirements

- An understanding of the following concepts
  - HTML + CSS
  - JavaScript
  - Document Object Model (DOM) and DOM manipulation
- A text editor of your choice (I will be using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
- A installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Built with -v 16.18.1)
- An eagerness to learn

## Agenda

The content we will be going over will include:

- React Initialization
- JSX
- Class Components vs Functional Components
- State
- Hooks
- Functional Components
- Props
- Conditional Rendering
- List Rendering
- React Router

We will wrap up the workshop by taking everything learned and combining it with create-react-app to build an E-Commerce Single Page Application (SPA)!

## Repo Tour

To correctly run each module, `cd` into the checkpoint you'd like to work on, run the command `npm install` to install the required packages, and finally, run the command `npm start` to start the web server.

- `./checkpoints`:
  - Inside you will find a folder for each module of the workshop that we will be covering
- `./project` (solution branch only):
  - The code to reference during the building portion of the workshop
- `./.gitignore`:
  - Hiding node modules and package-lock files from git
- `./README.md`:
  - Project introduction

## Resources

Different resources that will be helpful throughout the workshop:

- [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html)
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/default.asp)
