# React Refresh Workshop

## Welcome!

Hello, and welcome to the Emerging Digital Academy: React Refresh Workshop. Today we will be going over the fundamentals of Functional Base React, so by the end you will have the skills required to make practical React applications!

## Requirements

- An understanding of the following concepts
  - HTML + CSS
  - JavaScript
  - Document Object Model (DOM) and DOM manipulation
- A text editor of your choice (I will be using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
- A installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Built with -v 16.18.1)
- An eagerness to learn

## Agenda

The content we will be going over will include:

- React Initialization and JSX
- Class Components vs Functional Components
- Props
- Hooks
- State
- Conditional Rendering
- List Rendering
- React Router

We will wrap up the workshop by taking everything learned and combining it with create-react-app to build an E-Commerce Single Page Application (SPA)!

## Repo Tour
