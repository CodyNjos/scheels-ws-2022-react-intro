To initialize a new react app, run the command `npx create-react-app <app_name>` where <app_name> will be the name of your project.

**From CRA Docs:** If you have previously installed `create-react-app` globably via npm, run the command `npm uninstall -g create-react-app` (or globaly via yarn `yarn global remove create-react-app`) first. This is to ensure that npx is always using the latest versions of create-react-app.
